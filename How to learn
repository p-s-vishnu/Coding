How to learn
1. Quick Video to get started
2. Code it
3. Read an article /paper /in-depth video
4. Document the learning / Teach it to someone

5. Revise
---------------------------

Differentiate what requires depth and skimming
> Code, Theory and the Math



Common Questions
---------------------------
Gradient Descent 
> Udacity

Common Metrics (Maths, Code, theory)
check sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=metrics#module-sklearn.metrics

> Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Copens Kappa, AUC ROC, Confusion matrics

> Regression: MSE, MAE, mean poisson deviation

> Clustering: contingency matrix, WCSS (Within cluster sum of sqaure distance), Silhoutte score

Cost functions
> Log loss,
